INFO ON USING SEARCH SITES TO FIND WHAT YOUR LOOKING FOR!


if you consider moores law, then apply it to say a search "engine"
then fu** yeah! search results for days!

use toos like :inline  :intitle inline: intitle:

and sometimes benign things like  hack+the+world brings much better results especially when paired with

wifi
lan
lanparty
meetup
BBS
phreaking
goodoldays


get creative

seek multiple outputs from seperate engines, sometimes using a phone inside walmart is a great way to catch your stalker slipping
by scanning your ip from a different source!


anyways, Scrape away my friends. Scrape away.
