making text talk

not many people know this but there is a whole place called textland and its pretty fucking cool..

jk

its just anyfile turned to a text file and opened. :)

try it, but dont be dumb and change sys32 to txt while your on it! rip it and then move it to another computer inside a zip on a usb.
unpack and convert to text to save yourself the trouble of a alt-f4-your-sys-core dumb move like I do on mac all the time :(
